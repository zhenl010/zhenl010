========= The A* Pathfinding Project =========

The A* Pathfinding Project is an out-of-the-box pathfinding system
which along with ease of use has a large amount of features and blazing fast pathfinding.

The system has one Free version and one Pro version, both can found in the Unity Asset Store or on my website (see below)
	
Documentation for the system can be found at:
